so i just got an M3 pro macbook pro from work which has an 18 core gpu and a 12 core cpu. i want to test this stuff out! how can i write some code or something that leverages this cpu and gpu parallelism and then run it on another machine and see if i can notice a difference in how long it takes to run?

That's awesome! New hardware is always fun to play with. With your new M3 Pro MacBook Pro, you have a pretty powerful machine at your disposal. Let's try out some code to leverage both the CPU and GPU for parallel processing.

CPU Parallelism with multiprocessing
For CPU parallelism, we can use Python’s multiprocessing module. Let's run a computationally intensive task like matrix multiplication.

Here's a basic example of how to do matrix multiplication in parallel:

import multiprocessing as mp
import numpy as np
import time

def matrix_multiply(A, B, queue):
    result = np.dot(A, B)
    queue.put(result)

def cpu_parallel_example():
    size = 1000
    A = np.random.rand(size, size)
    B = np.random.rand(size, size)

    queue = mp.Queue()
    process = mp.Process(target=matrix_multiply, args=(A, B, queue))
    start_time = time.time()
    process.start()
    process.join()
    end_time = time.time()

    print(f"Result: \n{queue.get()}")
    print(f"CPU Parallelism Time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    cpu_parallel_example()
GPU Parallelism with numba
For GPU parallelism, you can use the Numba library, which can compile Python code to run on the GPU. Let’s do some element-wise addition of two arrays.

Here's an example using Numba:

from numba import cuda
import numpy as np
import time

@cuda.jit
def gpu_addition(A, B, C):
    idx = cuda.grid(1)
    if idx < A.size:
        C[idx] = A[idx] + B[idx]

def gpu_parallel_example():
    size = 1000000
    A = np.random.rand(size)
    B = np.random.rand(size)
    C = np.zeros(size)

    start_time = time.time()

    threads_per_block = 256
    blocks = (size + (threads_per_block - 1)) // threads_per_block
    
    gpu_addition[blocks, threads_per_block](A, B, C)

    cuda.synchronize()
    end_time = time.time()

    print(f"GPU Parallelism Time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
    print(f"Result: \n{C}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    gpu_parallel_example()
Running the Comparisons
Install Dependencies:

Ensure you have numpy, multiprocessing, and numba installed:
pip install numpy numba
Run the Code on Your MacBook Pro:

Save each code snippet into separate files (e.g., cpu_parallel_example.py and gpu_parallel_example.py).
Run them from the terminal:
python cpu_parallel_example.py
python gpu_parallel_example.py
Compare on Another Machine:

Run the same scripts on a different machine, which might have different CPU and GPU capabilities.
Compare the execution times logged by both scripts.
Expected Observations
CPU Parallelism: You should see a noticeable difference between utilizing a single core and leveraging multiple cores, especially for larger matrix sizes.
GPU Parallelism: Depending on your other machine's GPU capability, the array addition might be significantly faster on your M3 Pro MacBook Pro.
Further Exploration
Try larger problem sizes to better benchmark and stress-test both the CPU and GPU.
Experiment with other GPU-accelerated libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow if you delve into more complex computations or deep learning.
Feel free to tweak the examples to better suit your needs!

i told you i have an M3 mac. how the hell am i going to run cuda code on apple silicon?

gpt4 generic
Whoops! My bad. You're right — CUDA isn't supported on Apple Silicon Macs. Let's pivot and use Metal, Apple's framework for GPU programming, via a higher-level API. Since direct Metal programming is fairly low-level and cumbersome, leveraging libraries like Swift and Accelerate is more practical for your scenario.

Metal via Python and Swift
To keep things simple and more in line with Python, we can use Swift for the GPU programming part and bridge it with Python. Here's a high-level overview and some sample code to demonstrate CPU and Metal-based GPU computation for matrix multiplication.

Setup Environment
1. [CPU Example:](you can largely keep the same multiprocessing example)

Let's stick with Python's multiprocessing for the CPU example, as previously mentioned.

2. [GPU (Metal) Example in Swift:](using Apple's frameworks for computation)

You’ll need to write a Swift script, compile it, and call it from Python. Here's how you can do it:

Swift Code for GPU (using Accelerate Framework)
Save this Swift script (e.g., gpu_matrix_multiply.swift):

import Foundation
import Accelerate

func matrixMultiply() {
    let size = 1000
    var A = [Float](repeating: 0.0, count: size * size)
    var B = [Float](repeating: 0.0, count: size * size)
    var C = [Float](repeating: 0.0, count: size * size)
    
    // Populate A and B with random values
    for i in 0..<size*size {
        A[i] = Float(drand48())
        B[i] = Float(drand48())
    }

    let startTime = CFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent()
    
    // Perform matrix multiplication using Accelerate framework
    A.withUnsafeBufferPointer { A in
        B.withUnsafeBufferPointer { B in
            C.withUnsafeMutableBufferPointer { C in
                vDSP_mtrans(A.baseAddress!, vDSP_Stride(1), C.baseAddress!, vDSP_Stride(1), vDSP_Length(size), vDSP_Length(size))
                vDSP_mtrans(B.baseAddress!, vDSP_Stride(1), C.baseAddress!, vDSP_Stride(1), vDSP_Length(size), vDSP_Length(size))
                vDSP_mtrans(B.baseAddress!, vDSP_Stride(1), B.baseAddress!, vDSP_Stride(1), vDSP_Length(size), vDSP_Length(size))
                vDSP_mtrans(C.baseAddress!, vDSP_Stride(1), C.baseAddress!, vDSP_Stride(1), vDSP_Length(size), vDSP_Length(size))
            }
        }
    }
    
    let endTime = CFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent()
    print("GPU (Accelerate) Matrix Multiplication Time: \(endTime - startTime) seconds")
}

// Run the matrix multiply function
matrixMultiply()
3. [Compiling and Running the Swift Code:](adding steps to compile and run the Swift code)

Compile the Swift script:

swiftc -o gpu_matrix_multiply gpu_matrix_multiply.swift
Then you can run it directly:

./gpu_matrix_multiply
Python to Swift Bridging
You can also call this from Python if needed:

import subprocess
import time

def gpu_parallel_example():
    start_time = time.time()
    subprocess.run(["./gpu_matrix_multiply"])
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"Total Time (including overhead in Python): {end_time - start_time} seconds")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    gpu_parallel_example()
Combining It All
Install Dependencies for Python:

Ensure you have numpy installed:
pip install numpy
Run the CPU Example: Save the code from the earlier CPU example into a file and run it.

Compile and Run the Swift Code: Compile using swiftc as shown and test run the swift script.

Bridge to Python: Use the sample Python script to call the Swift executable and see the timings.

Summary
CPU Parallelism: You're using Python's multiprocessing to leverage the multiple cores.
GPU Parallelism (using Metal via Accelerate): You're using Swift's Accelerate framework for GPU-based matrix multiplication.
Comparison: You can now compare the results on your M3 MacBook Pro with another machine by measuring how execution times differ.
This approach ensures you're leveraging the full potential of your M3 Mac's hardware, even if CUDA isn’t available. Enjoy testing your new machine!

uhh this code does not compile lol. i get the error: "gpu_mat_multiply.swift:24:74: error: cannot convert value of type 'UnsafePointer<Float>' to expected argument type 'UnsafeMutablePointer<Float>' vDSP_mtrans(B.baseAddress!, vDSP_Stride(1), B.baseAddress!, vDSP_Stride(1), vDSP_Length(size), vDSP_Length(size))"

gpt4 generic
Alright, my bad on that, thanks for pointing it out. Accelerate vDSP functions often require UnsafeMutablePointer for output arguments. I also noticed some redundant operations in the example. Here’s a corrected and simplified version:

Corrected Swift Code for GPU
import Foundation
import Accelerate

func matrixMultiply() {
    let size = 1000
    let A = (0..<size*size).map{ _ in Float.random(in: 0..<1) }
    let B = (0..<size*size).map{ _ in Float.random(in: 0..<1) }
    var C = [Float](repeating: 0.0, count: size * size)
    
    let startTime = CFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent()
    
    // Perform matrix multiplication using Accelerate framework
    A.withUnsafeBufferPointer { a in
        B.withUnsafeBufferPointer { b in
            C.withUnsafeMutableBufferPointer { c in
                vDSP_mmul(a.baseAddress!, 1,
                          b.baseAddress!, 1,
                          c.baseAddress!, 1,
                          vDSP_Length(size), vDSP_Length(size), vDSP_Length(size))
            }
        }
    }
    
    let endTime = CFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent()
    print("GPU (Accelerate) Matrix Multiplication Time: \(endTime - startTime) seconds")
}

// Run the matrix multiply function
matrixMultiply()
Steps to Run the Corrected Swift Code
1. Save and Compile the Swift Code

Save the code as gpu_matrix_multiply.swift.

Compile it:

swiftc -o gpu_matrix_multiply gpu_matrix_multiply.swift
2. Run the Compiled Swift Executable

Run the executable directly:

./gpu_matrix_multiply
Python to Swift Bridging
3. Optionally, Call from Python

If you want to call this from Python:

import subprocess
import time

def gpu_parallel_example():
    start_time = time.time()
    subprocess.run(["./gpu_matrix_multiply"])
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"Total Time (including overhead in Python): {end_time - start_time} seconds")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    gpu_parallel_example()
Explanation
Data Population: We're using Float.random(in: 0..<1) to generate random floats for the matrices.
Corrected Pointer Types: The vDSP_mmul function properly uses UnsafeMutablePointer for the output matrix.
Matrix Multiplication: vDSP_mmul is the right function to multiply two matrices.
Summary
CPU Parallelism: You're using Python's multiprocessing to leverage multiple cores.
GPU Parallelism (using Accelerate): You leverage Swift’s Accelerate framework for matrix multiplication.
Comparison: Run and compare results on different machines to see execution time differences.
This should compile and run correctly on your M3 MacBook Pro. Enjoy playing with your new hardware, and let me know if you run into any more issues!
